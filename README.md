Project 2
Project Overview
This Project analyzes ride data from Transport X in Austin to identify ride patterns and develop predictive models. The goal is to understand ride deman based on various factors such as ride distance, time of day and external influences like weather conditions. The insights gained will help optimize transportation services and improve demand forecasting. While aslo being used to help operations in the newly launched market of Atlanta

Datasets
The dataset used in this analysis included ride data from Transportation X as well as imported weather data from Open Meteo containing:
Ride Start and End Times
Ride Distances
Total Revenue & per Mile and Minute
Pick up and Drop Off locations
Trip Durations
Tempature
Wind speed
Precipitation
Precipitation Category (None, Low, Medium, Heavy)

A jupyter notebook (james_workbook_for_austin.ipynb) is used to process and analyze the datasets. The dateset is cleaned, transformed, and visualized to extract meaningful insights before applying predictive modeling techniques.

Objectives
EDA: Identify trends, peak ride times, ride demand patterns, and the distribution of ride distances
Data Cleaning and Preperation: Handled missing values and ensured that data was in a usuable format for machine learning models. Standardized time formats, and created rush hour, hour, and precipitation categories
Predictive modeling: Developed a demand forecasting model using ride ride metrics and weather
Feature engineering: Created new variables such as Rush hour Rides and precipation category to better improve model accuracy
Hyperparameter tuning- Balanced precipition data sets to prevent overfitting, utilized grid search to identify best Random Forest model

Tools & Technologies

Python: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

pandas, NumPy for data processing

scikit-learn, statsmodels for machine learning and statistical analysis

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and experimentation

Machine Learning Models: Various regression and time-series models to predict ride demand.

Key Findings
Peak Ride demand occuring during specific hours of the day, particulary in the evening hours
Ride distances and duration vary based on time and weather
Machine learning models can successfully predict ride demand based on historical trends and external factors

Future Enhancements

Real-Time Weather Integration: Incorporate live weather data to dynamically adjust ride demand forecasts.

Geospatial Analysis: Map-based visualizations to better understand ride distribution patterns.

Extended Model Development: Experiment with deep learning models to improve prediction accuracy.

Dashboard Development: Create an interactive dashboard for real-time ride demand monitoring and analysis.
